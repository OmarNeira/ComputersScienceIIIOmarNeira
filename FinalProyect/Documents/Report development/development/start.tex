    This document presents the development of a specific purpose language for graphical designers. The language is supported by Python and multiple libraries to perform various tasks (mainly by Pillow). The grammar is in English to make it accessible to everyone, especially those who do not know how to program. The language is designed to automate tasks such as enhancing images, applying filters, and more.

\section{Introduction}
This specific purpose languaje is a languaje made for graphical 
designers, it is intended to make the work of the designer easier, 
it will be supported on python using multiple libraries so it can 
do multiple things, the grammar will be on English so everyone can 
use it, it is intended to be used by people that doesn't know how 
to program.
% THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\section{Justification}
This languaje was made thinking on graphical designers that need 
to work with a lot of images, so they can simply use this languaje 
to automatize tasks; for example they need to enhance a lot of 
images to a specific brightness, or apply a filter on them, they 
only need to select all those images with the languaje and tell it 
to auto apply it for them, a thing that manually can be really 
tedious and time consuming to make, but with the help of the 
languaje can be made really fast and easy.
