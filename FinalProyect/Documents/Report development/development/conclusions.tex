\section{Conclusions}
The develop of a specific pourpose languaje is a hard challenge, a lot of things has to be considered, such as the sintaxis, the semantic, the grammar, the operations, features, etc. Making first the design is really important because it gives an orientation to the development, thanks to identificate the pourpose, the lexems, tokens and keywords it became easier to develop the grammar and the operations for the languaje.\\
Thanks to pillow library, the operations were easy to implement, the main challenge was to make the operations work with the compiler, the compiler is able to "read" the text, analyze it, and apply the operations to the images translating it to Python.\\
The objective of the project was successfully achieved, the Designer Tools project is able to apply operations to a lot of images in a simple way, the user only has to write the text with the operations and the compiler will do the rest, making the graphical designer life easier.\\
Now Designer Tools can be expanded to have more features thanks to the way that the code was developed, it can be used by other developers to add more features to the project.\\
